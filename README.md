# Academic Vocab Explorer 

There are no available web API's for most (if any) of the popular
academic word lists (eg, Coxhead's AWL, Gardner and Davies's AVL)
, and so this is an attempt to create a simple web app where
students can practice interacting with these words.

The rollout will probably follow these phases:

## phase 1

* a basic homepage with a link to a page where you can search 
by word for words grouped by lemma (read the original article 
on the AVL, linked below, for more background) from the AVL data.

## phase 2

* adding a page to take a simple quiz, filling in gaps in text 
by selecting from choices presented, featuring different lemmas
of the same word

* the quiz will essentially be hardcoded

## phase 3

* adding a page to take a similar quiz as above, but not using
the same lemma for every answer

* the quiz will still be hardcoded

## phase 4

* adding a "challenge" option for the above two quizzes, where
the user will need to supply (type in) the answers instead of
just selecting them.

* the quiz will still be hardcoded

## phase 5

* the data used to populate the quizzes will come from an as-yet-undetermined data source (I'm gonna try not to use subreddits, but this might be the easiest win), and auto-refresh every day.

## phase 6

* the search will contain filters for different frequency levels 
of the vocabulary

* the quizzes will be grouped by frequency of vocabulary

## phase 7

* add user login to be able to track progress over time

* present simple reports for users on progress over time

## phase 8

* if it helps, I may try to merge in the data from the AWL as 
well
